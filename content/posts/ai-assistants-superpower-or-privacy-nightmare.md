Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants have become ubiquitous in our lives. From Siri and Alexa to Google Assistant, these virtual companions handle tasks, answer questions, and even control our smart homes. While their convenience is undeniable, concerns linger about the potential privacy breaches associated with constantly recording and analyzing user data.

This blog post dives into the world of AI assistants, exploring both the undeniable benefits they offer and the potential privacy risks we face.

* **Accessibility:**  Voice-activated assistants offer a valuable tool for those with physical limitations. 

**Privacy Concerns:**

* **Data Collection:**  AI assistants are constantly collecting voice data, raising concerns about what information is stored and how it's used.
